## Project Overview

Welcome to the Bank Loan Analysis project! In this project, I dived into a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data to uncover insights into lending patterns, risk factors, and loan performance. Leveraging SQL for data manipulation and Tableau for visualization, I aim to provide valuable insights to financial institutions for optimizing lending strategies and mitigating credit risks.

## Data Sources

The bank loan dataset used for this analysis comprises loan records obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains a comprehensive set of attributes related to individual loan applications and their corresponding outcomes, providing insights into lending practices, borrower demographics, and loan performance.The bank loan data is available for public access through Kaggle website. Researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders interested in analyzing loan data trends and implementing targeted interventions are encouraged to utilize this valuable resources.

## Tools Used

### SQL (Structured Query Language)

- Utilized for data manipulation, querying, and analysis.
- SQL queries were used to extract, transform, and analyze the loan data.

### Tableau

- Employed for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- Tableau dashboards were created to visualize key metrics, trends, and insights derived from the loan data
  
## Analysis Process

- Data Collection: Obtained bank loan datasets from Kaggle, containing information such as total loan application, funded amount, received amount, interest rate, DTI, etc.

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the raw bank data using Microsoft Excel to handle missing values, standardize formats, and remove duplicates.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized SQL queries to conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of loan attributes, Identified patterns, trends, and outliers in the loan data.

- Trend Analysis: Explored lending patterns based on loan term, interest rate, and borrower demographics, derived insights to optimize lending strategies and improve loan portfolio performance.

- Visualization: Created interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize key metrics and trends, designed dynamic visualizations to explore loan data from different perspectives.

## Results

- Identified key factors influencing loan performance, such as debt-to-income ratio and loan purpose.
  
- Visualized loan default rates by various attributes, enabling risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
  
- Developed interactive dashboards to monitor loan portfolio performance and track lending KPIs.

## Conclusion

The Bank Loan Analysis project provides valuable insights into lending practices, risk assessment, and portfolio management strategies. By leveraging SQL and Tableau, we aim to empower financial institutions with actionable insights for making informed lending decisions and optimizing loan performance.
